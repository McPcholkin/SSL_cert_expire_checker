# SSL_cert_expire_checker

Simple cert to check SSL expire date.   
Need to monitor cert status from zabbix, also can be used manualy (set DEBUG='true').

Based on  https://www.zabbix.com/forum/showthread.php?t=755 by jpawlowski and https://www.appliedtrust.com/blog/2011/11/keep-an-eye-on-those-certificate-expiration-dates


need optimize zabbix template...
